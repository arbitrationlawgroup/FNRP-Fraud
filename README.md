## Content Management

### Adding a New PDF Filing

1. Place the PDF file in `/public/docs/`
2. (Optional) Create a sidecar JSON file in `/content/filings/` with the same base filename:

```json
{
  "slug": "complaint-2025-08-14",
  "title": "Federal Complaint Filed â€“ First National Realty Partners",
  "date": "2025-08-14",
  "type": "Complaint",
  "court": "U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey",
  "docket": "2:25-cv-XXXXX",
  "summary": "Investors allege undisclosed fees, exaggerated returns, and use of affiliates to funnel investor funds.",
  "parties": ["Plaintiffs: [redacted]", "Defendants: First National Realty Partners, LLC, et al."],
  "pdf": "/docs/complaint-2025-08-14.pdf",
  "tags": ["fraud", "misrepresentation", "federal-court"]
}
```

If no sidecar JSON exists, the system will automatically infer metadata from the filename.

### Publishing a New Update

1. Create a new MDX file in `/content/updates/` with frontmatter:

```mdx

title: "Update Title"
date: "2025-08-21"
description: "Brief description of the update."
tags: ["investor-updates", "complaint"]
relatedFilings: ["complaint-2025-08-14"]
